# Artiststyle18
## Update
Released on November 21, 2023.
## Description
To have a fair comparison with baselines in the context of individual artistic style classification, we created a refined Wikiart dataset, named *Artiststyle18* dataset.
- **Size and composition**

The first-edition of *Artiststyle18* contains 4055 artwork images collected from 18 artists. Please refer to the [csv.file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zhu2xzMs1rBHVRvJqT4MNeJffTs1_eAq/view?usp=drive_link) for more details.
- **Principle and professionals**

The principle of image collection is based on the provision we made. For example, to ensure the consistency of the art styles in *Artiststyle18*, we manually selected the samples from *Wikiart* dateset (containing 52757 images), and 5 experts who have over 10 years art experience participated in the selection process, which they select the images according to their specific artistic styles and authors.
- **Download**

*Artiststyle18* can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LjEfsn_qd4vITWnUJq8HTjq0OSrSIA-r?usp=drive_link)(Size = 246Mb). We will continue expanding the dataset in the future.
