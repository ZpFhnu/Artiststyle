Released on November 21, 2023.
## Description
To have a fair comparison with baselines in the context of individual artistic style classification, we created a refined Wikiart dataset, named *Artiststyle* dataset.
- **Size and composition**

The first-edition of *Artiststyle* contains **4055** artwork images collected from **18** artists. Please refer to the [csv.file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zhu2xzMs1rBHVRvJqT4MNeJffTs1_eAq/view?usp=drive_link) for more details.
- **Principle and professionals**

Our research targets on individual artistic styles, so as the classes in *Artiststyle*. Specifically, images belonging to the same category have the same individual artistic style. Therefore, existing datasets like *WikiArt* (containing 52757 images) can not be used directly for training but need to be manually refined. 

For example, 1332 impressionist artworks by *Claude Monet* in *WikiArt* have different artistic styles considering fine-grained factors such as stroke and theme, so we collect 204 sharing the same artistic style from 1332 to form a category in *Artiststyle18*. 

**Five** **experts** who have over **10** years art experience participated in the selection process, during which they selected images according to their artistic styles and authors.
- **Download**

*Artiststyle* and related files can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LjEfsn_qd4vITWnUJq8HTjq0OSrSIA-r?usp=drive_link)(Size = 246Mb). We will continue expanding the dataset in the future.
